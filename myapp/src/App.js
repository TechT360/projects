            <h1>Hello React</h1>
            This page will be based on my interest during my leisure time.
            <p>
            During my leisure time, i'm either:
            At the Gym.
            Learning coding online.
            Watching Customised cars being driven.</p>

            <h2>Car:</h2>
            In the aspect of cars i'm a really big fan of the mustang gt500 shelby, 
            the sound that is produced from the car while being driven is astonishing 
            the Mustang GT500 is a muscle/sports car with the starting cost of over $72,900 price range,
            the car transmission is replaced with a TREMEC 7-SPEED dual-clutch transmission and a 5.2L V8 
            the engine of this car produces over 760 horsepower.
            Here is a link with the infos about the Mustang GT500 shelby:

            <h2>Music:</h2>
            I have a big interest with music, the flow and remedy in music is astonishing.
            music in a way is a form of therapy, the beauty of sounds being mixed together to make a decent
            melody which is amusing to the ears is breathe-taking.
